# Financial Record Analysis Tool
This repository contains a JavaScript tool designed to analyze financial records, specifically focusing on Profit/Losses over a given period. The analysis is based on a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

# Project Overview
The tool calculates several key financial metrics from the dataset:

Total Months: The total number of months included in the dataset.
Net Total Profit/Losses: The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
Average Change in Profit/Losses: The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period, calculated as Total/(Number of months - 1).
Greatest Increase in Profit/Losses: The date and the difference in the amounts for the greatest increase in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
Greatest Decrease in Profit/Losses: The date and the difference in the amounts for the greatest decrease in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

# Getting Started
Clone the Repository: First, copy the starter files into your local Git repository.
Prepare Your Dataset: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format, with arrays containing Date and Profit/Losses fields.
Install Dependencies: If the project requires any external libraries, make sure to include them in your project and install them.
Run the Analysis: Open the JavaScript file in a browser or a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js) to run the analysis.


# Usage
After setting up the project, you can run the analysis by executing the JavaScript file. The tool will process the dataset and output the calculated metrics in the browser's console or a specified output format.

# Expected Output
When you run the code in a browser, the resulting analysis should display the total number of months, the net total amount of Profit/Losses, the average change in Profit/Losses, and the dates and differences for the greatest increase and decrease in Profit/Losses. The output should be formatted clearly and concisely, making it easy for users to understand the financial insights derived from the dataset.
